Smartphone Sales Analysis from Flipkart ðŸ“±ðŸ’¼

Welcome to my latest data analysis project focused on smartphone sales data from Flipkart!

Project Overview:-

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of Flipkart's smartphone sales dataset to uncover valuable insights that can inform strategic decisions and drive business growth. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques, I delved deep into the dataset to understand consumer preferences, pricing dynamics, and market trends.

Key Highlights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored key metrics such as offer price, original price, discount percentage, total ratings, and more to gain insights into the dataset.

Price Analysis: Analyzed offer prices and original prices to identify trends, outliers, and optimal price points. This analysis provided valuable insights into consumer preferences and price sensitivity.

Price Sensitivity & Discount Analysis: Assessed the impact of price changes and discounts on sales volume to optimize pricing decisions and maximize revenue. Understanding price sensitivity among customers was crucial for strategic pricing.

Price vs. Sales Volume: Explored the relationship between price and sales volume to understand consumer behavior and market trends. This analysis helped identify correlations and patterns that can guide future marketing and sales efforts.
